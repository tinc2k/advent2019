# Advent of Code 2019 ðŸŽ„

Once again, I've decided to semi-seriously take part in this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019). I'll be solving this year's puzzles in JavaScript.

## Day 1: The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation 

- `Math.round()` vs. `Math.floor()`
- recursion in part two

## Day 2: 1202 Program Alarm

- memory, instructions, instruction pointer
- tried to copy an Array by doing `arr.splice()` without args which doesn't work, went with `arr.concat([])` instead
